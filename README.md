# Layr Sequencer

## Description

This project is the final capstone project that i made during my time at a Coding Bootcamp. It is built with a React Front-end and Rails Back-end for Auth. Coming from a musical background i really wanted to do something a bit different that was interactive and work with audio.
The Layr Sequencer features a 16-Step Sequencer page and a Jam page with a Piano and Drum Pad. This project very quickly became a passion project and is something that i will continue working on and adding new features in the future. I will list below what features i am currently working on adding in the near future.

## Sequencer Page

The 16x8 grid of buttons represents a series of sounds that will be played in a loop once selected. The bpm input box determines the beats played per minute, it is a measurement of tempo, followed by the play and stop buttons. For more info check help button on page.

## Jam Page

The Jam Page features a Piano and Drum pad built with CSS. Each Key and Pad are mapped to a key on the keyboard, sound will play once pressed. For more info check help button on page.

## Future Features

Currently the sequencer only enables the user with a stock default sound. In the near future id like to add more synths/drum kits that the user will be able to choose from in the sidebar. Currently the sidebar only houses FX functionality. I would also like to add a save and export button so the user can save or export their ideas. I am currently working on the recording functionality. Another feature that will be added in the near future is a scale select dropdown so the user can switch through multiple scales, currently its default to C-Minor scale.
